## Content

- Types of Data
- Exploring your dataset
- Descriptive Statistics
- Inferential Statistics

## Wait!

- Make sure `cchic` R dataframe from your work yesterday is loaded
- Ensure this includes the variables you created including `los`

::: notes
Help them load the dataset if needed. This is the same one they used in the morning. It should include the length of stay variable.

## The big picture

- Research often seeks to answer a question about a larger population by collecting data on a small portion 
- Data collection:
    - Many variables
    - For each person/unit.

## Descriptive and inferential statistics

- WAIT!
- First be aware of the types of data 
- Guides:
    - How best to describe the data you have
    - How best to analyse (which test)
        - Note that data scientists and pure statisticians moving away from being ‘test-focused’, but will discuss how to run some basic ones in this lesson. 

## Data types

- Continuous 
- Discrete
    - Nominal
    - Ordinal 
    - Interval

::: notes
Data types have been covered in course before. The next few slides should be a bit of a recap.
:::
## Continuous variables

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- e.g. age, height, weight 
- Have distributions:
    - Gaussian
    - Poisson
    - Binomial
    - Cauchy/Lorenz

- Can’t be described
:::
::: {.column}
![](Images/ContinuousDistribution.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

## What is normally distributed data?

![](Images/NormalDistribution.png)

## Types of discrete variables

- Nominal 
    - e.g. hair colour, types of antibiotics 
    - There is no order between the data types (e.g. blonde, brunette, red hair)

## Types of discrete variables

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Ordinal 
    - There is an order e.g. `care_level` where Level 3 > Level 2 > Level 1 etc.
    - However, the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 critical care may not be the same as the difference between Level 2 and Level 3. 
:::
::: {.column}
![](Images/OrdinalData.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

## Types of discrete data

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Interval
    - There is an order to data points (e.g. `age_cat` for age centile) and the difference
    between these points are equal (e.g. 10 years)
:::
::: {.column}
![](Images/IntervalData.png)

## Describing data

- Continuous variables
- Discrete variables

::: notes
How do we convey information on what your data looks like, using numbers or figures?
:::

## Describing continuous data.

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
First establish the distribution of the data. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(cchic, aes(x= age_years)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

What is the distribution of this data?
:::
::: {.column}
![](Images/AgeDistribution.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes
Get them to do this with you. 
:::

## What is the distribution of height?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

Try this command

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic, aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
What is the distribution of this data?
:::
::: {.column}
![](Images/HeightDistribution.png)

::::::::::::::

## Parametric vs non-parametric data

- Parametric data
    - The data follows a known distribution
    - It can be described using *parameters*
    - Examples of distributions include, normal, poission, exponential.

- Non parametric data
    - The data can't be said to follow a known distribution

::: notes
Emphasise that parametric is not equal to normal.
:::

## Describing parametric and non-parametric data

How do you use numbers to convey what your data looks like.

- Parametric data 
    - Use the parameters that describe the distribution.
    - For a Gaussian (normal) distribution - use mean and standard deviation
    - For a Poission distribution - use average event rate
    - etc.
- Non Parametric data
    - Use the median (the middle number when they are ranked from lowest to highest) and the interquartile range (the number 75% of the way up the list when ranked minus the number 25% of the way)

- You can use the command `summary(data_frame_name)` to get these numbers for each variable.

## Mean versus standard deviation

- What does standard deviation mean?
- Both graphs have the same mean (center), but the second one has data which is more spread out.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# small standard deviation
dummy_1 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 10, sd = 0.5)
dummy_1 <- as.data.frame(dummy_1)
ggplot(dummy_1, aes(x =dummy_1)) +
  geom_histogram()

# larger standard deviation
dummy_2 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 10, sd = 20)
dummy_2 <- as.data.frame(dummy_2)
ggplot(dummy_2, aes(x =dummy_2)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


::: notes
Get them to plot the graphs. Explain that we are generating ramdom data from different distributions and plotting them. 
::: 

## Calculating mean and standard deviation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(cchic$height, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sd(cchic$height, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The `na.rm` argument tells R to ignore missing values in the variable. What happens if you leave it out?

## Calculating median and interquartile range

```{r, eval = FALSE}
median(cchic$age_years, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
IQR(cchic$age_years, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Again, we ignore the missing values.

## Describing discrete data

- Frequencies
```{r, eval = FALSE}
table(cchic$care_level)
```

- Proportions
```{r, eval = FALSE}
care <- table(cchic$care_level)
prop.table (care)
```

- Percentatages
```{r, eval = FALSE}
PercTable(care)
```

## Inferential statistics

## Meaningful analysis

- What is your hypothesis

- What type of variables (data type) do you have?

- What are the assumptions of the test you are using?

- Interpreting the result

## What is a p-value?

![](Images/pValue.png)

## What we are usually hoping...

![](Images/pValue2.png)

## Testing significance

- p-value

- <0.05

- 0.03-0.049
    - Would benefit from further testing. 
    
## Comparing means

It all starts with a hypothesis

- Null hypothesis
    - “There is no difference in mean height between men and women”

- Alternate hypothesis
    - “There is a difference in mean height between men and women”
    
## More on hypothesis testing

- The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that the true mean difference (μd) is equal to zero.
- The two-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that μd is not equal to zero.
- The upper-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that μd is greater than zero.
- The lower-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that μd is less than zero.


- Remember: hypotheses are never about data, they are about the processes which produce the data. The value of μd is unknown. The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine the hypothesis (null or alternative) with which the data are more consistent.

## Comparing means

Is there a difference between the heights of males and females?

```{r}
cchic %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(av.height = mean(height, na.rm= TRUE))
```
    
Is the difference between heights statistically significant?

::: notes
Note that these number will not be the same as the one candidates see on their screens. These slides are based on a smaller version of the dataset. 
:::

## t-test

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Compares means between two populations
- Paired vs. Unpaired
:::
::: {.column}
![](Images/Ttest.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

## Assumptions of a t-test

- One independent categorical variable with 2 groups and one dependent continuous variable

- The dependent variable is approximately normally distributed in each group

- The observations are independent of each other

## Doing a t-test

Try:
```{r, error=TRUE}
t.test(cchic$height, cchic$sex)
```

Notice the error. `sex` is in the wrong format. 

## Doing a t-test

Correct this by changing the format of this variable in R.

```{r}
cchic <- cchic %>% 
  mutate(gender = as.factor(sex)) %>% 
  mutate(gender_num = as.numeric(gender))
```


Now do the test.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
t.test(cchic$height, cchic$gender_num)
```

::: notes
Explain why this works. Also note that the number will not be exactly the same as the the ones they will see. This is because these slides are using a smaller version of the dataset.
:::

## Doing the t-test

```{r, echo = FALSE}
t.test(cchic$height, cchic$gender_num)
```

::: notes
Quickly explain the main points of the output
:::

## Comparing counts

- Is survival different between genders?

```{r}
table(cchic$gender, cchic$vital_status)
```

## What is our hypothesis?

- Null hypothesis
    - There is no difference in survival between men and women 
    
- Alternate hypothesis
    - There is  a difference in survival between men and women 
    
## Assumptions of the chi-squared test.

1.  Data in cells should be frequencies or counts *not* percentages
2.  Levels/Categories are mutually exclusive – here being a alive/dead applies
3.  Each subject contributes to one cell – can either be male/female and alive/dead
4.  Independent study groups
5.  2 categorical variables
6.  Values in each cell should be 5+

`Biochem Med (Zagreb). 2013 Jun; 23(2): 143–149.`

## Doing the chi-squared test.

Start with `?chisq.test`. 
Then do the test.

```{r}
chisq.test(cchic$gender, cchic$vital_status)
```

::: notes
Again, explain the output from this.
:::

## Non paramteric versions

Is length of stay different between genders?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![Male](Images/LOSMale.png)
:::
::: {.column}
![Female](Images/LOSFemale.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

## When do you use a non-parametric test?

- When any of the the following are true.
    - Level of measurement is nominal or ordinal
    - Unequal sample sizes
    - Skewed data
    - Unequal variance
    - Continuous data collapsed into small number of categories
    
`Biochem Med (Zagreb). 2013 Jun; 23(2): 143–149.`

## Using the Mann Whitney test

`??Mann-Whitney` will show you that the command is actually called `wilcox.test`.

Both variables need to be in numeric format.

```{r}
cchic <- cchic %>% 
  mutate(los_num = as.numeric(los))
```

## Doing the test

```{r}
wilcox.test(cchic$los_num, cchic$gender_num)
```
