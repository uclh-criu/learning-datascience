## Content

- Motivation for R: what and why?
- R studio: a tour
- R building blocks
- Using/Writing functions 

## What is R?

- Free software for statistical computing and plotting
- Works with variety of platforms
    - UNIX
    - MacOS
    - Windows
- Built around handling data. 'Understands' data.
    - Particularly well suited to data science / statistics

## Why use R?

- Why not?
    - Need to learn a new language
    - Does not use 'point and click'
    - Need to describe to the computer the steps you want it to take
- Why?
    - You can do *anything*
    - Not limited to the pre-designed command process of an app.
    - You record everything you do, so you can do it again.

## Really, why R?

- Save time
    - Small upfront investment for long term gain
    - New data? - Easy
    - Repeat analysis? - Easy
    - Found an error? - Easy
- Reproducible Science
    - Code makes your analysis explicit
    - Writing code = writing lab-book = good reproducible science

## Working with RStudio 

- RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment.
- Easier to work with than R on it's own, since it it a bit more 'point and clicky'
- Allows
    - Code editing
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Plotting tools
    - Workspace management 

## This is what R on it's own looks like

::: notes
Ask learners to open RStudio, but don't get them to type anything in yet.
:::

## RStudio is made up of windows

![](../Images/RStudioHighlightWindows.png)

::: notes
Explain each window.

- Console - this is where R is run. Commands executed but not saved.
- Source - text files that contain commands.
- Environment - tells you which R objects you are working with.
- Files - actually a helper window. Gives you files, help, plots. Warn people not to delete files from their computer.

## Adjusting your view of RStudio.

![](../Images/RStudioButtonsHighlighted.png)

::: notes
Explain what each button does.
:::

## Using the Console window

![](../Images/RStudioConsole.png)

## Using the console

- Bottom left window.
- This is R!
- This is your prompt to type  `>`.
- Type `2 + 2` then hit `Enter`.

## Console output

You should see:

```{r}
2 + 2
```

-  `>` is the command prompt
-  `2 + 2` is the command
-  `4` is the output from R.
-  `[1]` is telling you that 4 is the first value in a sequence returned by R.

::: notes
Say that the ## sign is just printed on the slide as an indicator that we are seeing output rather than code entered. They shouldn't see the symbol on their consoles.
:::

## Using the Source

![](../Images/RStudioSource.png)

## Using the Source

- Type `2 + 2`, then `Enter`.
- What happens?
- To ask R to run code

- Highlight the code and:
    - MacOS: `Cmd + Enter`
    - Windows: `Ctrl + Enter`

- Notice the output in the console.

## Saving your work

- Click the `save` icon 
    - Save the file under a meaningful name. 
    - Save it somewhere you can find it again.
    - .R is the file extension for R scripts.
- Close the Source window
- Close R Studio
- Restart R Studio and click the `open` icon
- Find your file and open
- Your code still there
- You can run it again.

## R building blocks

- Names
- Data
    - Vectors
    - Data Frames
- Functions
    - Stored in packages

## 3 Main Building Blocks

- Names
    - Everything needs a name in R: tables, plots, data files
- Data
    - Data comes in different forms: Real Numbers/Counting Numbers/Characters etc.
    - Data is stored in vectors
    - Vectors are stored in data frames
- Functions
    - Little factories
    - Take an input (raw material) use function (factory) get an output (product)
    - Functions are collated into packages

## Names

- You assign names to objects in R.
- This is the assignment operator `<-`
- Shortcut:
    - Mac OSX: `Option + - `
    - Windows: `Alt + - `
- Return the stored value by typing the name.

```{r}
practice <- 2 + 2 + 6
practice
```

::: notes
Get them to do this.
:::

## Names

- You can store any object under a name.
- This example stores a string. You need to use quote marks to assign it.

```{r}
say_hello <- "hello"
say_hello
```

- Note that R does not like spaces in names.
```{r, error = TRUE}
say hello <- "hello"
```

## Data
- R is a statistical computing language
- It is built around an understanding of data
- Statistics uses:
    - Vectors
    - Data frames

## Vectors

- A vector contains elements of the same datatype.
    - A vector of integers - an example would be age
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19, 48)
```
    - A vector of real numbers - an example would be temperature.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(37.5, 37.1, 37.3, 38.3, 37.4, 38.9)
```
    - A vector of characters - an example would be name.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James")
```
    - A vector of logicals - an example would be 'are the blood results avaiblable?'
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
```
    
## Naming vectors.

The `c()` function combines individual values into a single vector.
```{r}
# Storing several ages in one vector.
age <- c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19)
age
# Storing several names in one vector.
name <- c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer")
name
```

## Recalling elements of a vector

- R creates an index for each element of the vector.
- It allocates a number to each element within the vector from left to right, starting with `1`.

```{r}
# The age of the second person.
age[2]
# The age of the fourth person.
age[4]
# The name of the fifth person.
name[5]
```

## Data Frames.
- You are already familiar with data frames

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female")
data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

- A data frame is a series of vectors aligned to form a table
- Each vector becomes a column in the table
- A properly formatted excel spreadsheet is essentially a data frame

## Creating a data frame - excercise

- Create and name vectors containing information about these 6 patients.
    - `Name: "Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer"`
    - `Age: 50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19`
    - `Gender: "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female"`
- Quotation marks are not needed for names in R, but are when your data is a string e.g. "male", "female"
- As a rule:
    - Characters on the left side of the assignment operator. No quote marks.
    - Characters on the right side of the assignment operator. Use quote marks if storing letters.

## Creating a data frame - exercise
- Combine these vectors into a data frame using `data.frame()`
    - Hint, the vector names need to go inside the `()`
- Save the data frame under the name `patients`
- Print the data frame called `patients` to your console

## Creating a data frame - solution


```{r}
# Creating individual vectors.

name <- c("Adam", "Sally", "Eve", "John", "James", "Jennifer")
age <- c(50, 25, 32, 67, 46, 19)
gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female")


# Combining into a data frame.

patients <- data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

## This is the data frame.
```{r}
patients
```

- R arranges the vectors as columns in the data frame
- R names the columns of the data frame after the names of the vectors
- R numbers each row of the data frame

## Recalling a vector in a data frame
- Data frame colums are vectors.
- `$` can be used to extract a vector from a data frame.
- We can get the `age` column from the data frame `group`
```{r}
patients$age
```

## Vectors - other properties
- Add a value of TRUE to a vector of integers
- Give it a name
- Recall the vector
- Use `str()` to examine the structure of the vector.
- What has happened?

## Vectors - other properties

```{r}
test <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, TRUE)
test
str(test)
```

- The value of `TRUE` has been changed to 1.
- The vector is still a numeric vector

## Vectors - other properties
- Add a string to a vector of integers
- Recall the vector
- What has happened?

## Vectors - other properties

```{r}
test2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, "hi")
test2
str(test2)
```


- The string has been added on to the end of the vector.
- The vector is now a string vector.

## Functions as factories

## Functions as factories
![](../Images/Function3.png)


## Functions
- Sometimes taught as a "black box"
- You can think of them as a factory
- Usually labelled as a verb (they are "doing" something)
- Many come built into R
    - `Sys.time()`
    - `mean(1:100)`
- You can also install 'packages' containing bundles of functions

- View each function as a separate separate factory in a production line

## Functions in a line
![](../Images/Function4.png)

## Functions
- You have been using functions already!
- `data.frame()` is a function.
- `age, gender, weight` are arguments.

```{r}
data.frame(name, age, gender)
```

- The data frame is the output

## Try these functions yourself. What do they do?
- Use the `group` data frame as the argument.

- `head()`
- `tail()`
- `summary()`
- `mean()`

## Try these functions yourself.
- `head()` Gives you the first 6 rows
- `tail()` Gives you the last 6 rows
- `summary()` Gives an overview of the object
- `mean()` Gives the mean of a numeric vector

## Warning note
- Functions are carrying out pre-written instructions
- They will fail if they are supplied with the wrong kind of data - they will return an error message instead
- Try `mean(group$gender)`
- There are other constraints
- Dependent on the function itself
- HINT: some functions will not work with missing values
- You will then need to specify the argument to remove these missing values

## Help with functions
- How do you find out how to use a particular function?
- Three ways:
    - Select the `help` tab in bottom right of RStudio, then type the function name into the search box, and read the help page.
    - Type `?function_name` into the console.
    - If you can’t remember the exact function name try typing `??whatever_you_want_to_do` into the console. It searches the whole database for matching terms.

::: notes
Get them to look up the help page for mean
:::

## This is what a help page looks like.
![](../Images/HelpPage.png)

## Reading the help page

- It's quite complicated.
- But the information is usually displayed in a standard format:
    - Brief description
    - An example of use
    - The argument(s) that can be passed to the function - along with any default value it takes if there is no value provided.
    - Breakdown of these arguments. Gives you more information about what you need to put in.
    - Tells you how the function works and what to expect to see in the output. 
    - A reproducible example of use, that you can normally use verbatim.
    
## Explore functions yourself

- Look up the function `ls`
- What are the arguments you can give the function?

    - How do you specify the argument for 'pattern'? Try it
    - When might this be useful?

    - How do you specify the argument for 'sorted'? Try it
    - When might this be useful?

::: notes
Work through this with them.

## Packages - collections of functions

- There are bunch of functions that come with R. They are 'base R' functions.

- Thousands of open access functions in other packages
- To access these: install the packages, then load them.

- Let's install and load the 'tidyverse' package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

- You can now use all of the functions that come with 'tidyverse'.
- You need to load the package using `library` each time you open R. But you will not need to install it again.

::: notes
Get them to load tidyverse. Emphasise that this is a process we will keep repeating throughout the course. 
:::

## Other useful packages

These are some packages we will be user later in the course.

- `ggplot2` - plots graphs in R
- `readr` - imports data into R
- `stringr` - helps you manipulate strings
- `lubridate` - helps you manipulate dates

::: notes
Maybe mention that a few of these packages are loaded with tidyverse.
